# Binary search algorithm
This is my first learned algorithm, binary search. Actually it's have a very simple work principle.

I got that binary search algorithm will take logâ‚‚(n) steps, where n is a data list length. This means that algorithm is so fast.


I'll keep learning primary and necessary algorithms.
